
// ***NOTICE!  This entity will probably go completely unused.
// Likely never used by the map as it's not mentioned in ts_fgd.ffd,
// and our own logic for weapons does not use an entity anyway.
// This was likely used to represent a weapon in the player's
// inventory in the original game, since CTSWorldGun is clearly the
// in-world pickup.
