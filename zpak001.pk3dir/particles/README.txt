
fx_explosion, fx_impact, and fx_spark.cfg are copied from FreeHL ("valve" folder).  If these end up unused by FreeTS, remove accordingly.

explosion.cfg is for a grenade explosion effect ripped from an old version of FreeCS I think (if not, The Wastes, but I doubt this).

Same for the sound script files (mirrored in the sound folder adjacent to this dir)
